# UNIHACK Platform: Project Structure Fix & Exam Gating - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Exam Gating Implementation
- **Updated `src/data/admissionTests.ts`**: Added `enabled` flag and `note` field to exam interface
- **Only SAT & TMUA enabled**: All other exams show "Coming soon" 
- **UI Implementation**: Disabled exams are greyed out, non-clickable, with accessibility support
- **API Validation**: `ProfileAPI.saveOnboardingData()` now validates that only enabled exams can be selected
- **Error Handling**: User gets clear "Exam not available yet" message if disabled exam is submitted

### 2. Enhanced User Experience  
- **Onboarding Flow**: Exam selection now shows disabled state with "Coming soon" badges
- **Dashboard Warning**: Shows alert banner if user has disabled exams in their profile
- **University Filtering**: Only shows universities relevant to enabled exam types
- **Topic Filtering**: Only shows topics from enabled exams
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, screen reader support

### 3. Data Consistency
- **Helper Functions**: Added `isExamEnabled()`, `getEnabledExams()`, `getExamById()`
- **Topic Mapping**: Updated to filter out disabled exams
- **University Filters**: Enhanced to only consider enabled exams for country filtering
- **Profile API**: Validation prevents saving disabled exam selections

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Exam Status by Type:
- ✅ **SAT**: Fully enabled with complete topic set
- ✅ **TMUA**: Fully enabled with complete topic set  
- 🚧 **UCAT**: Disabled - "Coming soon"
- 🚧 **STEP**: Disabled - "Coming soon"
- 🚧 **GRE**: Disabled - "Coming soon"
- 🚧 **GMAT**: Disabled - "Coming soon"
- 🚧 **MAT**: Disabled - "Coming soon"

### User Flow Impact:
1. **Onboarding**: Users can only select SAT/TMUA, others are clearly marked as coming soon
2. **University Selection**: Intelligently filtered based on enabled exam selections
3. **Dashboard**: Shows warning if profile contains disabled exams
4. **Practice**: Only shows topics from enabled exams

### Security & Validation:
- **Frontend Gating**: UI prevents selection of disabled exams
- **Backend Validation**: API rejects requests with disabled exams
- **Error Messages**: Clear feedback when disabled exams are attempted
- **Data Integrity**: Existing profiles with disabled exams are handled gracefully

## 🏗️ Project Structure Status

### Current Structure:
```
/frontend/       -> React + TypeScript app (Active)
/backend/        -> Django app (Active) 
/src/           -> Frontend source code (Active - Lovable managed)
package.json    -> Root package.json (Lovable managed)
README.md       -> Project documentation
```

### Note on Structure:
Due to Lovable's requirements, the project maintains a unified structure where:
- Frontend code lives in `/src` (Lovable convention)
- Backend code lives in `/backend` (separate Django app)
- Root `package.json` is managed by Lovable
- Both frontend and backend are fully functional and isolated

## 🧪 Testing & Verification

### Manual Testing Checklist:
- [x] Only SAT & TMUA selectable in onboarding
- [x] Other exams show "Coming soon" and are disabled
- [x] Clicking disabled exam shows toast notification
- [x] University filtering works correctly for enabled exams
- [x] Dashboard shows warning for profiles with disabled exams
- [x] API validation prevents saving disabled exam selections
- [x] Topics only show for enabled exams
- [x] Accessibility: keyboard navigation and screen readers work correctly

### Error Scenarios Handled:
- User attempts to select disabled exam → Blocked with toast message
- API call with disabled exam → Returns 400 error with clear message  
- Existing profile with disabled exam → Shows warning banner
- No enabled exams selected → Shows all universities (fallback)

## 🚀 Next Steps

### For Full Project Structure Cleanup (Future):
1. Migrate to pure frontend/backend split when not constrained by platform requirements
2. Add CI/CD checks for project structure validation
3. Implement workspace-based package management

### For Exam Expansion:
1. Enable additional exams by setting `enabled: true` in `admissionTests.ts`
2. Ensure corresponding university mappings are updated
3. Add comprehensive topic sets for newly enabled exams
4. Update UI messaging and documentation

### For Enhanced Features:
1. Add progress tracking for enabled exams
2. Implement adaptive difficulty based on exam type
3. Add exam-specific practice modes
4. Enhance analytics for enabled exam types
